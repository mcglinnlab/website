  abstract = {Various ecological mechanisms influence the forms of species richness
relationships (SRRs). These mechanisms can be gathered under five general categories: more
individuals, environmental heterogeneity, dispersal limitations, biotic interactions, and
multiple species pools. Often only the first two categories are discussed. In contrast, we
examine all five and explore how they can influence the form of SRRs. We discuss how various
sampling schemes and methods of SRR construction can be used to gain insight about how
various processes influence species richness patterns. The field is ripe for probing these effects
through more complex simulation models or more sophisticated mathematical approaches. To
facilitate deeper understanding, we need to embrace the full spectrum of SRRs and reconsider
the assumed common knowledge about the functional form of SRRs.
The relationship between species richness and the space or time over which it is sampled has
received increasing attention over the past decade, resulting in extensive debates about
terminology and methods of construction. These debates reflect deep conceptual issues; to
resolve them we discuss the long history of species richness relationships (SRRs) and the
connections among different methodological and terminological approaches. We reinforce
recent calls to organize the variety of methods used to construct SRRs into a cohesive
structure. SRRs are descriptors of various aspects of inventory (a- and c-) diversity and the
various types of SRRs serve different purposes. Contrary to most claims, SRRs do not provide
a direct measure of differentiation (b-) diversity.},
