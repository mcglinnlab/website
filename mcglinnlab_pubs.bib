	abstract = {Various ecological mechanisms influence the forms of species richness
relationships (SRRs). These mechanisms can be gathered under five general categories: more
individuals, environmental heterogeneity, dispersal limitations, biotic interactions, and
multiple species pools. Often only the first two categories are discussed. In contrast, we
examine all five and explore how they can influence the form of SRRs. We discuss how various
sampling schemes and methods of SRR construction can be used to gain insight about how
various processes influence species richness patterns. The field is ripe for probing these effects
through more complex simulation models or more sophisticated mathematical approaches. To
facilitate deeper understanding, we need to embrace the full spectrum of SRRs and reconsider
the assumed common knowledge about the functional form of SRRs.
The relationship between species richness and the space or time over which it is sampled has
received increasing attention over the past decade, resulting in extensive debates about
terminology and methods of construction. These debates reflect deep conceptual issues; to
resolve them we discuss the long history of species richness relationships (SRRs) and the
connections among different methodological and terminological approaches. We reinforce
recent calls to organize the variety of methods used to construct SRRs into a cohesive
structure. SRRs are descriptors of various aspects of inventory (a- and c-) diversity and the
various types of SRRs serve different purposes. Contrary to most claims, SRRs do not provide
a direct measure of differentiation (b-) diversity.},

Specifically, the ETH suggests that regions, and spatial scales, that exhibit a larger rate of environmental distance decay (DD) should exhibit more rapid rates of species turnover. The ETH should apply over any range of scales where the environment is driving species distributions. To examine the relevance of the ETH at local spatial scales, we tested for a positive relationship between the rate of change in soil chemical properties and vascular plant species composition in grassland and woodland habitats. We recorded presence–absence data along a 1.883 km transect in each habitat and estimated the rate of turnover and environmental DD for spatial lags of 1–41 m. We found that the soil environment explained spatial patterns of species composition more accurately in the grassland habitat compared to the woodland habitat. Consequently the rate of change in soil properties as a function of spatial distance was significantly positively correlated with the rate of species turnover in the grassland but not the woodland. Our study suggests that one of the central premises of the ETH is relevant for local patterns of species turnover if the environment appears to influence species composition.},

monitored birds in a Cross Timbers community that had recently experienced an F3 tornado. We surveyed the avian community 6 times during summer of 2 years. We performed surveys along three transects in the impacted site, a nearby non-impacted site, and a grassland. Species richness and composition were significantly different among habitats, but these differences were not related primarily to damage by the tornado. A partial canonical-correspondence analysis suggested that differences among habitats were due to species segregating between habitats with trees (impacted and non-impacted forests) and those without trees (grassland). It appeared that the avian community did not respond strongly to impact of the tornado. We suggest that avian communities in relatively open and patchy forests, such as the Cross Timbers, will not respond as strongly to localized disturbance from wind as will communities in more mesic, closed-canopy forests. Open woodlands lack adequate habitat for species that occupy interiors of forests; these species are expected to segregate the strongest between impacted and non-impacted sites.},

The purpose of this study was to develop a process-based stochastic model for the STAR that assumes species neutrality and to compare the model's expectations to data collected on plant species in a tallgrass prairie. We varied two important aspects of the neutral species assemblage: evenness in the species pool and individual replacement rate (R). When R is larger than 0.5 and evenness is intermediate to high, the neutral STAR generates patterns qualitatively similar to the empirical STAR. Our model also indicates that space and time were not symmetrical in their effects on species accumulation, except in the special case of R = 1.0. We observed both positive and negative time-by-area interactions in the sampling model, which indicates that nonzero interactions are not necessarily evidence of ecological processes. Furthermore, as accumulated richness approaches the size of the species pool, the time-by-area interaction becomes increasingly negative in our model. This suggests that negative time-by-area interactions should be expected a priori in empirical systems if rates of species accumulation decrease due to increasing rarity of unique species. Given the wide range of STARs that the sampling model generated, the difficulty in estimating key parameters, and the complexity of assessing the relative abundance distribution and scale of the species pool, we cannot refute the sampling effect, and we suggest caution in accepting ecologically oriented explanations of empirical STARs.},

However, these previous links only apply in a special case where turnover is scale invariant, and we demonstrate across three different plant communities that over 90\% of the pairwise turnover values are larger than expected based on scale-invariant predictions from the SAR. Furthermore, the degree of scale dependence in turnover was negatively related to the degree of variance in the occupancy frequency distribution (OFD). These findings suggest that species turnover diverges from scale invariance, and as such pairwise turnover and the slope of the SAR are not redundant. Furthermore, models developed to explain the OFD should be linked with those developed to explain species turnover to achieve a more unified understanding of community structure.},

	abstract = {Aim

The maximum entropy theory of ecology (METE) is a unified theory of biodiversity that attempts to simultaneously predict patterns of species abundance, size and spatial structure. The spatial predictions of this theory have repeatedly performed well at predicting diversity patterns across scales. However, the theoretical development and evaluation of METE has focused on predicting patterns that ignore intersite spatial correlations. As a result the theory has not been evaluated using one of the core components of spatial structure. We develop and test a semi-recursive version of the spatially explicit predictions of METE for the distance–decay relationship of community similarity and compare its performance with the classic random placement model of completely random species distributions. This provides a better understanding and stronger test of the spatial community predictions of METE.


Location

New World tropical and temperate plant communities.


Methods

We analytically derived and simulated the spatially explicit expectations of METE for the Sørensen index of community similarity. We then compared the distance–decay of community similarity of 16 mapped plant communities with METE and the random placement model.


Results

The version of METE we examined was successful at capturing the general functional form of the observed distance–decay relationships, a negative power function relationship between community similarity and distance. However, the semi-recursive approach consistently predicted lower intercepts and higher slopes than observed in the empirical distance–decay relationships and yielded worse predictions than the random placement model.


Main conclusions

Our results suggest that while the current spatial models of METE accurately predict the spatial scaling of species occupancy, and therefore core ecological patterns like the species–area relationship, its semi-recursive form does not accurately characterize spatially explicit patterns of correlation. More generally, this suggests that tests of spatial theories based only on the species–area relationship may appear to support the underlying theory despite significant deviations in important aspects of spatial structure.},

Differences in RAP fraction between temperate and tropical angiosperm trees (21.1 ± 7.9\% vs 36.2 ± 13.4\%, respectively) are due to differences in the AP fraction, which is typically three times higher in tropical than in temperate trees, but not in RP fraction.

	abstract = {Estimating biodiversity and its change in space and time poses serious methodological challenges. First, there has been a long debate on how to quantify biodiversity, and second, measurements of biodiversity and its change are scale-dependent. Therefore, comparisons of biodiversity metrics between communities are ideally carried out across scales. Simulations can be used to study the behaviour of biodiversity metrics across scales, but most approaches are system specific, plagued by large parameter spaces, and therefore cumbersome to use and interpret. However, realistic spatial biodiversity patterns can be generated without reference to ecological processes, which suggests a simple simulation framework as important tool for ecologists. Here, we present the r package mobsim that allows users to simulate the abundances and the distributions of individuals of different species in a spatially explicit landscape. Users can define key properties of communities, including the total number of individuals, the species-abundance distribution (SAD) and the degree of intraspecific spatial aggregation. Furthermore, the package provides functions that derive biodiversity measures, such as rarefaction curves and species–area relationships (SAR), from simulated communities or from observed data, as well as functions that simulate different sampling designs. We show several example applications of the package. First, we illustrate how species rarefaction and accumulation curves can be used to disentangle changes in the fundamental components that underlie biodiversity: (i) total abundance, (ii) species-abundance distribution and (iii) species aggregation. Second, we demonstrate how mobsim can be applied to assess the performance of species-richness estimators. The latter indicates how spatial aggregation challenges classical non-spatial species-richness estimators. mobsim allows the simulation and analysis of a large range of biodiversity scenarios and sampling designs in a comprehensive way by directly manipulating key community properties. The simplicity and control provided by the package also makes it a useful didactic tool. The combination of controlled simulations and their analysis will facilitate a more rigorous interpretation of real-world data that exhibit sampling effects and scale dependence.},

	abstract = {Because biodiversity is multidimensional and scale-dependent, it is challenging to estimate its change. However, it is unclear (1) how much scale-dependence matters for empirical studies, and (2) if it does matter, how exactly we should quantify biodiversity change. To address the first question, we analysed studies with comparisons among multiple assemblages, and found that rarefaction curves frequently crossed, implying reversals in the ranking of species richness across spatial scales. Moreover, the most frequently measured aspect of diversity – species richness – was poorly correlated with other measures of diversity. Second, we collated studies that included spatial scale in their estimates of biodiversity change in response to ecological drivers and found frequent and strong scale-dependence, including nearly 10\% of studies which showed that biodiversity changes switched directions across scales. Having established the complexity of empirical biodiversity comparisons, we describe a synthesis of methods based on rarefaction curves that allow more explicit analyses of spatial and sampling effects on biodiversity comparisons. We use a case study of nutrient additions in experimental ponds to illustrate how this multi-dimensional and multi-scale perspective informs the responses of biodiversity to ecological drivers.},

	abstract = {Little consensus has emerged regarding how proximate and ultimate drivers such as productivity, disturbance and temperature may affect species richness and other aspects of biodiversity. Part of the confusion is that most studies examine species richness at a single spatial scale and ignore how the underlying components of species richness can vary with spatial scale.
We provide an approach for the measurement of biodiversity that decomposes changes in species rarefaction curves into proximate components attributed to: (a) the species abundance distribution, (b) density of individuals and (c) the spatial arrangement of individuals. We decompose species richness by comparing spatial and nonspatial sample‐ and individual‐based species rarefaction curves that differentially capture the influence of these components to estimate the relative importance of each in driving patterns of species richness change.
We tested the validity of our method on simulated data, and we demonstrate it on empirical data on plant species richness in invaded and uninvaded woodlands. We integrated these methods into a new r package (mobr).
The metrics that mobr provides will allow ecologists to move beyond comparisons of species richness in response to ecological drivers at a single spatial scale toward a dissection of the proximate components that determine species richness across scales.},

Fires range from slow smouldering peat fires, to low-intensity surface fires, to intense crown fires, depending on vegetation structure, fuel moisture, prevailing climate, and weather conditions. While the links between biogeochemistry, climate and fire are widely studied within Earth system science, these relationships are also mediated by fuels—namely plants and their litter—that are the product of evolutionary and ecological processes. Fire is a powerful selective force and, over their evolutionary history, plants have evolved traits that both tolerate and promote fire numerous times and across diverse clades. Here we outline a conceptual framework of how plant traits determine the flammability of ecosystems and interact with climate and weather to influence fire regimes. We explore how these evolutionary and ecological processes scale to impact biogeochemical and Earth system processes. Finally, we outline several research challenges that, when resolved, will improve our understanding of the role of plant evolution in mediating the fire feedbacks driving Earth system processes. Understanding current patterns of fire and vegetation, as well as patterns of fire over geological time, requires research that incorporates evolutionary biology, ecology, biogeography, and the biogeosciences.},

Early angiosperms are thought of as woody evergreens restricted to warm, wet habitats. They have since expanded into numerous cold and dry places. This expansion may have included transitions across important environmental thresholds. To understand linear and nonlinear relationships between angiosperm structure and biogeographic distributions, we integrated large datasets of growth habits, conduit sizes, leaf phenologies, evolutionary histories, and environmental limits. We consider current-day patterns and develop a new evolutionary model to investigate processes that created them. The macroecological pattern was clear: herbs had lower minimum temperature and precipitation limits. In woody species, conduit sizes were smaller in evergreens and related to species’ minimum temperatures. Across evolutionary timescales, our new modeling approach found conduit sizes in deciduous species decreased linearly with minimum temperature limits. By contrast, evergreen species had a sigmoidal relationship with minimum temperature limits and an inflection overlapping freezing. These results suggest freezing represented an important threshold for evergreen but not deciduous woody angiosperms. Global success of angiosperms appears tied to a small set of alternative solutions when faced with a novel environmental threshold.},

	abstract = {Questions: Species rarefaction curves have long been used for estimating the expected number of species as a function of sampling effort. Nonetheless, sampling species based on standard plant inventories represents an effort-intensive approach. Hence, rarefaction based on remotely sensed information can provide a rapid tool for identifying regions with exceptional richness and turnover. The aim of this paper is to examine (i) if the rates of spectral and species accumulation are positively correlated with one another at different spatial scales, and (ii) if the strength of this correlation differs between regions of varying landscape complexity. Location: Switzerland, Europe. Methods: The plant species data were derived from the Swiss “Biodiversity Monitoring” programme. Seven Landsat ETM+ images covering the whole study area were acquired. We applied species and spectral rarefaction for five biogeographical areas ranging from flat to mountainous zones. The relative increments (rates) of the species and spectral rarefaction curves were compared using Pearson correlation together with locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS). Results: The biogeographic regions differed from one another in both their spectral and species diversity. The relationship between spectrally- and species-derived rates of accumulation was non-significant in simple landscapes, but we observed a significant positive correlation in complex landscapes over fine-to-intermediate spatial scales. Conclusions: Spectral rarefaction represents a powerful tool for measuring landscape diversity and potentially predicting species diversity at regional to global spatial scales. Based on remotely sensed information, more efficient diversity-based monitoring programmes can be developed.},

	abstract = {Early flowering plants are thought to have been woody species restricted to warm habitats1,2,3. This lineage has since radiated into almost every climate, with manifold growth forms4. As angiosperms spread and climate changed, they evolved mechanisms to cope with episodic freezing. To explore the evolution of traits underpinning the ability to persist in freezing conditions, we assembled a large species-level database of growth habit (woody or herbaceous; 49,064 species), as well as leaf phenology (evergreen or deciduous), diameter of hydraulic conduits (that is, xylem vessels and tracheids) and climate occupancies (exposure to freezing). To model the evolution of species’ traits and climate occupancies, we combined these data with an unparalleled dated molecular phylogeny (32,223 species) for land plants. Here we show that woody clades successfully moved into freezing-prone environments by either possessing transport networks of small safe conduits5 and/or shutting down hydraulic function by dropping leaves during freezing. Herbaceous species largely avoided freezing periods by senescing cheaply constructed aboveground tissue. Growth habit has long been considered labile6, but we find that growth habit was less labile than climate occupancy. Additionally, freezing environments were largely filled by lineages that had already become herbs or, when remaining woody, already had small conduits (that is, the trait evolved before the climate occupancy). By contrast, most deciduous woody lineages had an evolutionary shift to seasonally shedding their leaves only after exposure to freezing (that is, the climate occupancy evolved before the trait). For angiosperms to inhabit novel cold environments they had to gain new structural and functional trait solutions; our results suggest that many of these solutions were probably acquired before their foray into the cold.},

By contrast, the minority associate with ectomycorrhizal (EM) fungi, have abandoned the symbiosis and are nonmycorrhizal (NM), or engage in an intermediate, weakly AM symbiosis (AMNM). To understand the processes that maintain the mycorrhizal symbiosis or cause its loss, we reconstructed its evolution using a ∼3,000-species seed plant phylogeny integrated with mycorrhizal state information. Reconstruction indicated that the common ancestor of seed plants most likely associated with AM fungi and that the EM, NM, and AMNM states descended from the AM state. Direct transitions from the AM state to the EM and NM states were infrequent and generally irreversible, implying that natural selection or genetic constraint could promote stasis once a particular state evolved. However, the evolution of the NM state was more frequent via an indirect pathway through the AMNM state, suggesting that weakening of the AM symbiosis is a necessary precursor to mutualism abandonment. Nevertheless, reversions from the AMNM state back to the AM state were an order of magnitude more likely than transitions to the NM state, suggesting that natural selection favors the AM symbiosis over mutualism abandonment.},

Columns biostimulated with one of three carbon sources, along with non-stimulated controls, developed into complete (ethene production, whey amended), partial (cis-dichloroethene (DCE) and VC, an emulsified oil with nonionic surfactant), limited ({\textless}5 \% cis-DCE and 95 \% TCE, an emulsified oil), and non- (controls) TCE dehalogenating systems. Bioaugmentation of one column of each treatment with Bachman Road enrichment culture did not change Dhc populations nor the eventual degree of TCE dehalogenation. Pyrosequencing revealed high diversity among Dhc strains. There were 13 OTUs that were represented by more than 1000 sequences each. Cornell group-related populations dominated in complete TCE dehalogenating columns, while Pinellas group related Dhc dominated in all other treatments. General microbial communities varied with biostimulation, and three distinct microbial communities were established: one each for whey, oils, and control treatments. Bacterial genera, including Dehalobacter, Desulfitobacterium, Sulfurospirillum, Desulfuromonas, and Geobacter, all capable of partial TCE dehalogenation, were abundant in the limited and partial TCE dehalogenating systems. Dhc strain diversity was wider than previously reported and their composition within the community varied significantly depending on the nature of the carbon source applied and/or changes in the Dhc associated partners that fostered different biogeochemical conditions across the columns.},

We tested two assumptions of the patch-burn approach, namely that: (1) fire and grazing drive spatial patch differentiation in community structure and (2) species composition of patches change through time in response to disturbance. Methods We analyzed species cover data on 100 m2 square quadrats from 128 sites located on a 1 × 1 km UTM grid in the grassland habitats of the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve. A total of 20 of these sites were annually sampled for 12 years. We examined how strongly changes in species richness and species composition correlated with changes in management variables relative to independent spatial and temporal drivers using multiple regression and direct ordination, respectively. Results Site effects, probably due to edaphic differences, explained the majority of variation in richness and composition. Interannual variation in fire and grazing management was relatively unimportant relative to inherent site and year drivers with respect to both richness and composition; however, the effects of fire and grazing variables were statistically significant and interpretable, and bison management was positively correlated with plant richness. Conclusions There was some support for the two assumptions of patch-burn management we examined; however, in situ spatial and temporal environmental heterogeneity played a much larger role than management in shaping both plant richness and composition. Our results suggest that fine-tuning the application of fire and grazing may not be critical for maintaining landscape scale plant diversity in disturbance-prone ecosystems.},

The ribbed mussel Geukensia demissa is a mytilid bivalve, which is an ecologically important foundation species. Despite experiencing commercial harvesting pressure in South Carolina, G. demissa currently lacks speciesspecific regulations in terms of minimum harvest size and harvest limits. Furthermore, the distribution of G. demissa within its habitat, although well described in the Northeastern United States, has not been studied in South Carolina. The goal of the present study was to develop a methodology that could be used to characterize the distribution of G. demissa using elevation and salinity data to improve the understanding of the distribution of this species at the landscape scale and to support consideration of improved management measures. Transect grid surveys for the presence or absence of G. demissa were performed at stations along a salinity gradient in the Ashley River, a tributary of the Charleston Harbor, SC, in the spring of 2017. The presence or absence of G. demissa was explained by both elevation and salinity data using a logistic regression model, and G. demissa was predicted to be most likely to occur at a high position in the intertidal zone (0.17mbelow mean high water) and at an intermediate salinity of 18. In addition, the tidal inundation period for G. demissa in this study ranged from 45 min to 6 h, and averaged 3.5 h per high tide, highlighting the physiological challenges of its typical habitat distribution.},

	abstract = {The role of biotic and abiotic factors in shaping the diversity and composition of communities of plant viruses remain understudied, particularly in natural settings. In this study, we test the effects of host identity, location, and sampling year on the taxonomic composition of plant viruses in six native plant species [Ambrosia psilostachya (Asteraceae), Vernonia baldwinii (Asteraceae), Asclepias viridis (Asclepiadaceae), Ruellia humilis (Acanthaceae), Panicum virgatum (Poaceae) and Sorghastrum nutans (Poaceae)] from the Nature Conservancy’s Tallgrass Prairie Preserve in northeastern Oklahoma. We sampled over 400 specimens of the target host plants from twenty sites (plots) in the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve over 4 years and tested them for the presence of plant viruses applying virus-like particle and double-stranded RNA enrichment methods. Many of the viral sequences identified could not be readily assigned to species, either due to their novelty or the shortness of the sequence. We thus grouped our putative viruses into operational viral taxonomic units for further analysis. Partial canonical correspondence analysis revealed that the taxonomic composition of plant viruses in the target species had a significant relationship with host species (P value: 0.001) but no clear relation with sampling site or year. Variation partitioning further showed that host identity explained about 2–5 per cent of the variation in plant virus composition. We could not interpret the significant relationship between virus composition and host plants with respect to host taxonomy or ecology. Only six operational viral taxonomic units had over 5 per cent incidence over a 4-year period, while the remainder exhibited sporadic infection of the target hosts. This study is the first of its kind to document the dynamics of the entire range of viruses in multiple plant species in a natural setting.},

	abstract = {Parenchyma represents a critically important living tissue in the sapwood of the secondary xylem of woody angiosperms. Considering various interactions between parenchyma and water transporting vessels, we hypothesize a structure–function relationship between both cell types. Through a generalized additive mixed model approach based on 2,332 woody angiosperm species derived from the literature, we explored the relationship between the proportion and spatial distribution of ray and axial parenchyma and vessel size, while controlling for maximum plant height and a range of climatic factors. When factoring in maximum plant height, we found that with increasing mean annual temperatures, mean vessel diameter showed a positive correlation with axial parenchyma proportion and arrangement, but not for ray parenchyma. Species with a high axial parenchyma tissue fraction tend to have wide vessels, with most of the parenchyma packed around vessels, whereas species with small diameter vessels show a reduced amount of axial parenchyma that is not directly connected to vessels. This finding provides evidence for independent functions of axial parenchyma and ray parenchyma in large vesselled species and further supports a strong role for axial parenchyma in long-distance xylem water transport.},
