Sam joined the lab in the fall of 2018 and graduated in 2021 with his MS in
Environmental Studies program. He received a grant from the USDA to examine the
usefulness of *Salicornia* (sea pickle) for restoring dredged soil.

Since then he started his own company (Heron Farms)[https://www.heronfarms.com/]
which he calles the worldâ€™s first indoor vertical saltwater farm.
