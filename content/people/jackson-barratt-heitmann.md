Jackson joined the lab in 2021. He is a student in the Environmental and
Sustainability Studies Program (EVSS). He graduated with a BA in Global &
International Studies from Bard College in2018. After completing his
undergraduate degree he worked for the Maine Natural Areas Program doing
invasive plant management and worked for Audubon New York doing environmental
education, before returning to Bard as an assistant researcher on multiple
behavior ecology studies focusing on polarized light pollution effects on birds
and insects. Jackon's research interests include avian conservation, land
management, and community ecology. His thesis will look at how different types
of disturbance influence bird community composition in ephemeral wetlands, here
in the lowcountry.
