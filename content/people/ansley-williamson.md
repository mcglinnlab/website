Ansley joined the lab in 2022. She was a student in the Environmental and
Sustainability Studies Program (EVSS). She graduated with a BS in Natural
Resources & Environmental Management from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa in
2019. After completing her undergraduate degree she was set to volunteer for the
Peace Corps in Senegal as a Sustainable Agriculture Volunteer before the
COVID-19 pandemic derailed her plans. Ansleyâ€™s research interests include
wildlife conservation, invasive species management, disease ecology, and
community ecology. Her thesis examined the soundscape of ephemeral
wetlands and the efficacy of acoustic and artificial intelligence methods.

Ansley is currently working as a Conservation Planner (A.C.E. Contractor) NWRS
Inventory and Monitoring Branch for the Southeast Region of the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service
