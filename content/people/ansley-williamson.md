![Ansley Williamson](/img/ansley-williamson.jpg)

Ansley joined the lab in 2022. She is a student in the Environmental and
Sustainability Studies Program (EVSS). She graduated with a BS in Natural
Resources & Environmental Management from the University of Hawai'i at Manoa in
2019. After completing her undergraduate degree she was set to volunteer for the
Peace Corps in Senegal as a Sustainable Agriculture Volunteer before the
COVID-19 pandemic derailed her plans. Ansleyâ€™s research interests include
wildlife conservation, invasive species management, disease ecology, and
community ecology. Her thesis will look at what the soundscape of ephemeral
wetlands can tell us about the drivers of songbird and anuran community
composition and diversity as well as the efficacy of acoustic and artificial
intelligence methods.
