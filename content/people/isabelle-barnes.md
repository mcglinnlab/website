![Isabelle Barnes](/img/isabelle-barnes.jpg)

Isabelle joined the lab in 2023. She is a student in the Environmental and
Sustainability Studies Program (EVSS). She graduated with a BS in Conservation
Biology from Furman University in 2022. After completing her undergraduate
degree she worked as an on-site biologist for the Army Corps of Engineers at
Croft State Park in Spartanburg, South Carolina before making the decision to
continue her education. Isabelle’s research interests include forest ecology,
sustainable land management, wildlife conservation, and community ecology. Her
thesis investigated how various wetland restoration strategies, specifically
those involving canopy removal, influence avian communities in small,
geographically isolated wetlands.
