abstract = "It is well known that species diversity declines with increasing latitude. However, the underlying causes and mechanisms remain ambiguous due to effects of scale, the shape of the species abundance distributions (SAD), the total number of individuals (N) and the spatial aggregation of individuals (AGG). In this study, we examine how SAD, N and AGG contribute to the latitudinal richness gradient. Our study is based on a dataset that includes tree, shrub, and herbaceous plants collected from 445 permanent forest plots scattered across an expansive temperate forest region, covering latitudes from 39.71°N to 53.37°N. We compared multiple diversity patterns along the latitude between three life forms (trees, shrubs and herbs) and analyzed the effects of SAD, N and AGG on the latitudinal richness gradient. Our results reveal a general decline in most diversity measures along the latitudinal gradient, with the exception of herbaceous plants. Furthermore, we observed consistent effects of AGG and SAD on the latitudinal richness gradient across all three life forms. Specifically, a decreasing species evenness with increasing latitude led to a reduction in richness, while the simultaneous decrease in spatial aggregation, along with the effects of total number of individuals, collectively contributed to the decline in species richness with increasing latitude. However, the effect of total abundance varies among life forms, with a negligible effect on tree richness, a negative effect on shrub richness, and a significantly positive effect on herbaceous richness. These findings highlight the dependency of the “more-individuals hypothesis” on specific life forms. Our study shows that decomposing species richness into community structure components provides an opportunity for linking specific processes to latitudinal diversity gradients."
