R package that is actively being developed for estimating biodiversity and the
components of its change. The key innovations of this R package over other R
packages that also carry out rarefaction (e.g., vegan, iNext) is that mobr is
focused on:

1) making empirical comparisons between treatments or gradients, and

2) our framework emphasizes how changes in biodiversity are linked to changes 
in community structure: the SAD, total abundance, and spatial aggregation.

The concepts and methods behind this R package are described in the following 
publications.
