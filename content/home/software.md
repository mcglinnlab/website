We collaborate on software for biodiveristy data management, analysis and simulation. 

- [Measurement of Biodiversity](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/): A suite of tools for analysing and simulating scale dependence in biodiversity
    * **mobr** [R](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobr) and [Rshiny](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobr_app)
    * **mobsim** [R](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobsim) and [Rshiny](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobsim_app)

We have worked with our collaborators in the [Weecology lab](https://weecology.org) to develop the R package for the [Data Retriever](https://www.data-retriever.org/): A package manager for data. It downloads, cleans, and stores publicly available data, so analysts
  spend less time managing data, and more time analyzing it. Available
  for
  [R](https://github.com/ropensci/rdataretriever),
